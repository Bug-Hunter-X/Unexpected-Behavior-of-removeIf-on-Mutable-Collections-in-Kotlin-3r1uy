This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the `removeIf` function in Kotlin when used with mutable collections. The bug showcases how the behavior of `removeIf` can differ across different mutable collection types (Lists, Sets, Maps). This can lead to unexpected results or runtime exceptions if not carefully handled. The provided solution focuses on safe ways of removing elements based on a condition across different collection types.  Understanding this nuance is crucial for writing robust and predictable Kotlin code.
